\begin{frame}{Garbage Collection in C\#}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item In C\# there is an inbuilt Garbage Collector which will  walk through the Object Graph
		\pause \item It will check to see if the object is still allocated, if not, the Garbage Collector will cleanup the object
		\pause \item This process is automatic and  tuned for maximum performance

\begin{frame}{Memory - General Good Practices}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Avoid allocate or deallocate during game update (this includes Instantiate)
		\pause \item Use Memory Pools to recycle objects, especially objects which act like bullets or units
