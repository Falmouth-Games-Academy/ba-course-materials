\begin{frame}{More on Editor Scripts}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All editor scripts should be placed in an Editor Folder
		\item You have to add a using statement for \textbf{UnityEditor} to the top of the source file
		\item You can create custom Inspectors for Scripts using Property Drawer or you can take complete control and create a Custom editor
		\item You can also add custom menu items, this then allows you to create Wizards for common tasks
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Immediate Mode GUI}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a separate system from Unity's Game Object based UI System
		\item You write the GUI entirely in code, this code has to be in the OnGUI (or equivalent) function or be in a function that is called by OnGUI
		\item All logic for the controls have to go into this function, e.g to detect button presses
		\item You can customise the look n' feel of the editor using GUI Styles and Skins
